- **Trackball mount**: Files in `case/trackball/`
- **Dongle case**: Files in `case/dongle/`

---

## Battery Recommendations

### Right Half Battery (Critical for Trackball)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The PMW3610 trackball sensor consumes significant power. I **recommend using a 1000mAh** for the right half instead of a standard 130mAh battery.

#### Battery Comparison

| Capacity     | Runtime | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| **130mAh**   | ~2-3 days | Insufficient for trackball usage|
| **1000mAh**  | ~7-10 days | **Recommended** for trackball configurations |

#### Battery Selection Tips

1. **Form Factor**: Ensure the battery fits within the allocated space in your case
2. **Connector**: Use JST-PH 2.0 connectors for consistency
3. **Quality**: Choose reputable brands (e.g., Adafruit, Sparkfun)
4. **Voltage**: Should be 3.7V nominal (standard LiPo/LiPo)

#### Left Half Battery

The left half can use a standard **500mAh battery** since it doesn't power the trackball sensor.

### Installation Notes

- Route battery cables through designated paths to avoid pinching
- Use kapton tape to insulate battery connectors
- Secure batteries with double-sided tape or velcro
- Leave enough space for safe removal and replacement
- Never force batteries into tight spaces; modify the case if needed

## Building Firmware

### Option 1: Local Build (Recommended for Quick Testing)

The fastest way to build firmware locally is using the containerized Docker build system.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- This repository cloned on your machine

#### Build Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the local build directory
cd local-build

# Build all firmwares
docker-compose run --rm builder

# Build specific shield (e.g., charybdis_bt for Bluetooth only)
docker-compose run --rm builder -s charybdis_bt

# Build specific keymap (e.g., qwerty only)
docker-compose run --rm builder -k qwerty

# Enable USB logging for debugging
docker-compose run --rm builder -l true
```

#### Output

The built firmware files will be in `build_output/` organized by shield and keymap:

```
build_output/
├── charybdis_bt_qwerty/
│   ├── charybdis_left.uf2
│   └── charybdis_right.uf2
├── charybdis_dongle_qwerty/
│   ├── charybdis_left.uf2
│   ├── charybdis_right.uf2
│   └── charybdis_dongle.uf2
└── ...
```

See the [local build README](local-build/README.md) for more details, including USB logging and troubleshooting.

### Option 2: GitHub Actions (CI/CD Pipeline)

For automatic builds on every push:

1. **Fork or clone** this repository
2. **Push your changes** to GitHub
3. **GitHub Actions** automatically builds your firmware
4. **Download artifacts** from the Actions tab

#### Advantages

- No local toolchain setup required
- Builds run on GitHub servers
- Automatic artifact publishing
- Perfect for collaborative development

#### Disadvantages

- Slower feedback loop (~5-10 minutes per build)
- Requires GitHub account
- Limited to GitHub's CI/CD schedule

## Dongle + Trackball Configuration

### Overview

The dongle configuration allows you to use a **wireless dongle with USB connection**, supporting the **PMW3610 trackball sensor** for an all-in-one wireless input device.

### Components Required

- **Charybdis Dongle** (receiver with nice!nano v2)
- **Left and right keyboard halves**
- **PMW3610 trackball sensor** (mounted on right half)
- **USB-C cable** (for connection to computer)
- **Appropriate batteries** (see [Battery Recommendations](#battery-recommendations))

### Configuration Files

Dongle-specific configurations are in `boards/shields/charybdis_dongle/`:

- `charybdis_dongle.conf` - Dongle-specific settings
- `charybdis_dongle.overlay` - Pin definitions
- Keyboard halves use same files as Bluetooth version

### Trackball + Dongle Features

- **Full trackball support** with PMW3610 sensor
- **USB connection** to computer
- **Shared configuration** between Bluetooth and Dongle modes

### Building Dongle Firmware with Trackball

```bash
cd local-build

# Build dongle firmware with trackball support
docker-compose run --rm builder -s charybdis_dongle -k qwerty
```

### Trackball Behavior Configuration

All trackball parameters are configured in `config/charybdis_pointer.dtsi`:

```dts
// Example: Adjust pointer speed
// Modify values in charybdis_pointer.dtsi
pointer {
    speed = <1000>;      // Pointer speed multiplier
    acceleration = <0>;  // Acceleration curve
};

// Example: Configure scrolling
scrolling {
    speed = <5>;         // Scroll speed
};
```

For detailed trackball customization, see [Modifying Trackball Behavior](#modifying-trackball-behavior) in the main README.

### Dongle Display Support

> **Note:** Display support for the dongle is currently under development. Check the [zmk-dongle-screen](https://github.com/janpfischer/zmk-dongle-screen) repository for the latest updates.

The dongle can be equipped with a **1.69" SPI display** for status information. Wiring guide available in `docs/nice_nano_wire_guide.md`.

## Keyboard Layouts

This firmware supports multiple keyboard layouts out of the box:

### Supported Layouts

| Layout | File | Status | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| **QWERTY** | `config/keymap/qwerty.keymap` | ✅ Primary | Standard English layout |
| **Polish** | Custom config | ✅ Supported | See [Polish Layout](#polish-layout) |
| **Russian** | Custom config | ✅ Supported | See [Russian Layout](#russian-layout) |

### Polish Layout

Polish keyboard layout is fully supported through custom key mappings. Configuration files:

- `config/keys_pl.h` - Polish character definitions
- Add to your keymap: `#include "keys_pl.h"`

Polish-specific keys include: Ą, Ć, Ę, Ł, Ń, Ó, Ś, Ź, Ż and their uppercase variants. No need to switch. Use RAlt for special characters.

### Russian Layout

Russian (Cyrillic) keyboard layout is fully supported. Configuration files:

- `config/keys_ru.h` - Russian character definitions
- Add to your keymap: `#include "keys_ru.h"`

Russian-specific keys provide access to Cyrillic alphabet and common symbols.
To enable Russian input, switch your OS keyboard layout to Russian(cmd+space) and switch to Russian layer(will enable all required inputs).

### Adding Custom Layouts

To add a new layout:

1. Create a new `.keymap` file in `config/keymap/`
2. Define your key mappings following ZMK syntax
3. Reference any custom key definitions (e.g., `keys_pl.h`, `keys_ru.h`)
4. Build the firmware - it will automatically detect and build your new layout

Example:

```bash
# Copy and modify an existing keymap
cp config/keymap/qwerty.keymap config/keymap/my_layout.keymap

# Edit my_layout.keymap with your custom mappings

# Build - it will automatically include my_layout
cd local-build
docker-compose run --rm builder
```

## Flashing Firmware

### Prerequisites

- Downloaded firmware (`.uf2` files)
- USB-C cable
- One device at a time (you'll repeat for each half/dongle)

### Flashing Steps

1. **Unzip the firmware package**

   ```bash
   unzip charybdis-qwerty-dongle.zip
   ```

2. **Enter bootloader mode**

   - Plug the device into your computer via USB
   - **Double-press the reset button** on the nice!nano v2
   - The device should mount as `NICENANO` storage device

3. **Copy the firmware file**

   ```bash
   # On Windows
   copy charybdis_left.uf2 F:\  # Replace F:\ with your NICENANO drive

   # On macOS/Linux
   cp charybdis_left.uf2 /Volumes/NICENANO/
   ```

4. **Wait for programming**

   - The file will be copied
   - The device will automatically unmount
   - LED will flash indicating successful programming
   - The device will restart

5. **Repeat for other halves**

   - Repeat steps 2-4 for `charybdis_right.uf2`
   - If using dongle, also flash `charybdis_dongle.uf2`

### First-Time Setup

> ⚠️ **Important:** If flashing for the first time or switching between Bluetooth and Dongle configurations:

1. **Flash the reset firmware first** to all devices:

   ```bash
   # Available in firmwares/ directory
   # Flash settings_reset.uf2 to each device
   ```

2. Then proceed with normal firmware flashing

This clears any previous pairing information and ensures a clean state.

### Troubleshooting Flashing

- **Device not mounting**: Try a different USB port or cable
- **Still in bootloader**: Hold reset button while plugging in for 3 seconds
- **File copy fails**: Ensure the drive is properly mounted
- **Device won't restart**: Check the firmware file is not corrupted

## Modifying Trackball Behavior

The trackball uses ZMK's modular input processor system for easy customization.

### Configuration File

All trackball settings are in `config/charybdis_pointer.dtsi`.

### Common Adjustments

#### Pointer Speed

```dts
// In charybdis_pointer.dtsi
pointer {
    speed = <1000>;  // Increase for faster movement (1000-2000)
};
```

#### Acceleration

```dts
// Add acceleration curve
pointer {
    acceleration = <250>;  // Adjust sensitivity ramp-up
};
```

#### Scroll Behavior

```dts
// Configure scrolling
scrolling {
    speed = <5>;  // Scroll distance per movement
};
```

#### Precision Mode

```dts
// Slow pointer speed for detailed work
slow-pointer {
    speed = <200>;  // Much slower than normal
};
```

### Building After Changes

After modifying `charybdis_pointer.dtsi`:

```bash
cd local-build
docker-compose run --rm builder
```

The changes will be compiled into the new firmware.

- **Mouse-Click + Symbol-Layer - K37**
    - Tap: Left mouse click
    - Tap & Hold: Layer 3 (symbols) while the key is held
    - Double-Tap & Hold: holds the left mouse button
    - Tripple-Tap: Double mouse click
- **Backspace + Number-Layer - K38**
    - Tap: Backspace
    - Hold: Layer 1 (numbers) while the key is held
    - Double-Tap & Hold: Keeps Backspace held
- **Bluetooth profile quick-swap:** Jump to the EXTRAS layer and tap the dedicated BT-select keys to pair or switch among up to four saved hosts (plus BT CLR to forget all).
- **PMW3610 low power trackball sensor driver:** Provided by [badjeff](https://github.com/badjeff/zmk-pmw3610-driver)
    - Patched to remove build warnings and prevent cursor jump on wake
- **Hold-tap side-aware triggers:** Each HRM key only becomes a modifier if the opposite half is active, preventing accidental holds while one-handed.
- **Quick-tap / prior-idle:** Tuned for faster mod-vs-tap detection.
- **ZMK Studio:** Supported on BT builds for quick and easy keymap adjustments. Dongle support will come soon.
